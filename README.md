A simple implementation a Deep Learning models' training loop built on top of [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org) with maximal compatibility with that framework in mind. Learning and entertainment alongside with robustness and clean code.

## Intro

The [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org) framework provides a very clean and straightforward interface to build (Deep) Machine Learning models and read the datasets from a persistent storage. So let's use the best features of this great tool and write a set of thin and transparent wrappers on top of it to build a general-purpose training/validation loop that will be able to accept [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataset.html#Dataset) and [`Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/nn/modules/module.html#Module) instances, and run training process using modern Deep Learning training techniques.

## Roadmap

The features and improvements to be implemeted:

- [x] Basic implementation of training loop for CNN-based image classification models
- [ ] Simplify training loop instantiation
- [ ] Make possible to pass plain PyTorch classes and objects directly into the loop and utils
- [ ] More callbacks (early stopping, model saver, [`visdom`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) integration, etc.)
- [ ] CNN regression
- [ ] Smoke tests and sanity checks to verify the correctness of training process 
- [ ] Adding more examples and applications (Jupyter notebooks)
- [ ] Continuous integration
- [ ] Benchmarking on "classical" image datasets
- [ ] Basic set of image augmentations
- [ ] Basic RNN support
- [ ] Basic GAN support

## Dependencies

- psutil
- numpy
- pandas
- torch
- torchvision
- (dev only) pytest

## If you need something mature and robust

Please check the following project (especially, the last one) if you would like to have a more product-ready solution with less manual work and more levels of abstraction:

  1. [Ignite](https://pytorch.org/ignite/) — an official high-level interface for PyTorch

  2. [Torchsample](https://github.com/ncullen93/torchsample) — a Keras-like wrapper with callbacks, augmentation, and handy utils

  3. [Skorch](https://github.com/dnouri/skorch) — a scikit-learn compatible neural network library

  4. [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) — a powerful end-to-end solution to train Deep Learning models of various complexity with high accuracy and computation speed

## Outro

The repository started as an author's attempt to write some simple solution to train an image classifier with modern Deep Learning training techniques as described in [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-model-training-loop-e41055a24b73).
